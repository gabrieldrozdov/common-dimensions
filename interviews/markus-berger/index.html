				<p class="interview-text-content-lead">
					In fall 2023, we visited artist, architect, and educator Markus Berger at the Repair Atelier, an art/design workshop in Providence, RI that investigates and activates ideas of reuse. The Repair Atelier was created by Markus as a collaborative space for rethinking and reusing discarded and broken objects with the goal of transforming not just the objects themselves but also the communities that form around them. 				
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> The first time we visited you here at the workshop, we noticed those two chair skeletons hanging at the back of the room. While they’re deconstructed into individual parts, they’re still somehow recognizable as chairs. The way they’re arranged and mounted on these boards also makes them look uncannily like human skeletons. What are these objects? How did they come to be?

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> These pieces were made at the very beginning when I first decided I didn’t want to work with buildings (and contractors, budgets, and clients) anymore, but instead wanted to pursue my own self-directed work. They came out of an investigative process to figure out how to take abandoned objects, thrown-away objects, and give them a new life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the process of repairing a broken wooden chair, I first unmake the chair in order to clean all the joints before putting them back together again. I was trying to do this with this one particular chair, and within this process of disassembly, I arranged all of the pieces very nicely on a table in my workshop.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The next day, when I walked back into the workshop, I imagined seeing parts of a body. I was kind of set back at first, but then I saw this opportunity—I discovered within these fragments of a chair that there is this resemblance of body parts. From there, I started rearranging the pieces in different ways and generating “divergent beings.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Something that’s been important to me for some time, even prior to starting the Repair Atelier, was the idea of finding and breaking boundaries between (false) separations within art and design fields. Since I started teaching at RISD, I’ve been interested in breaking boundaries between art and design, breaking boundaries when it comes to what architecture should do (and certainly also what interior architecture should do). I’m also interested in breaking cultural boundaries, normative boundaries etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					So when I saw these pieces of a chair lying on that table, I saw that they somehow “speak” chair, yet they are not “chair.” They bring up this ambiguity that I love to play and also teach with—an ambiguity that makes unclear what an object was and is, a blurring of its boundaries.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> I think these skeleton-like objects, these “divergent beings,” are quite interesting formally in that they contain within them a tension between an object (a chair) and the human body. They are chairs, but they feel human. And looking at them almost feels like looking at a head, arms, a body. They’re compelling, strange-looking objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> Part of this has to do with the way I arranged them. The skeletal arrangement exacerbates that. Maybe this was not necessary, and maybe I should think about removing or distorting them a little because it’s possible that the body is almost too literally involved here. That said, their human form was very important to me when I started this entire process.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I first started this project, the first prototype I made completely failed. In fact, it actually broke while I sat on it during my crit in front of my entire cohort. The horror! But it was a valuable lesson—embarrassment is the greatest teacher. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The original idea for this project was that the chair would fold up into a wooden suitcase, and then easily unfold into a simple chair (not unlike a Jacob’s ladder toy). I was heavily influenced by Hennessy and Papanek’s <em>Nomadic Furniture</em> (another design meme), and their utopian vision of DIY reality. I even called this first version the Nomad Chair, leaving little to the imagination. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the second iteration of the <em>dis/assembly chair</em> series, I used the incredible resource of the Rare Woods Collection at RISD and got 50 board feet of Sugarpine for free. The soft wood is famously strong and lightweight (it’s often used in Japan for construction), and it was perfect for this project. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This had me wonder why I ever bought any new materials when there is so much incredible trash lying around RISD. If I could make a silly chair from an old shipping crate (which I had done for a previous project), I wondered what else would be possible and decided to focus on using scrap materials as much as I could.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now to get back to your question. At first I wanted this to be a chair that you could take apart and put back together over and over again. But as I began testing it with friends and faculty, I realized that I was more interested in the concept of dis/assembly rather than its actual functionality. Instead of taking the chair apart and putting it back together over and over again, you put it together once and the longer it stays assembled, the stronger it becomes. Wood grows and shrinks with the seasons, and the way these chairs were designed, they grow into themselves the longer the owner has them. The reality is that constant disassembly slowly weakens the object. On the other hand, slow, intentional assembly gains strength with time. No need for glue or screws when you’ve got time.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a way, this is slow furniture. (or at least a response to fast furniture). Ultimately, this chair series is a flatpack manifesto that favors interaction and permanence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> A few years ago, you made made a work in collaboration with Grace Carver called “fuck IKEA”. Can you tell me a little bit about that project and how it fits into the broader conversation you seem to be having (through the objects you make) with the mass-market furniture production model as a whole?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> In many ways, this was my first serious design project (while at the same time it was anything but serious). I studied for a semester at Elisava School of Design in Barcelona as an undergraduate with zero design experience. Thankfully, I was paired with Grace, a design student from Melbourne, Australia, who unlike me, did know her shit. In this furniture design class we both took, our professor gave each group an <span class="hover interview-text-highlight" onclick="openPopup('ivar-ikea-chair')">Ivar IKEA chair</span> (a classic Supernormal chair), and we had to make it into a “new” redesigned chair. Grace and I decided to make the anti-Ivar chair. We were interested in seeing how far we could stray from its original form and have it still be considered a chair.
				</p>
				<p>
					We completely took the chair apart. We then suspended each of its deconstructed pieces in <span class="hover interview-text-highlight" onclick="openPopup('solid-blocks-of-cement')">solid blocks of cement</span> and stacked them on top of each other so that they vaguely resembled a four-legged chair again. It looked insane. It was reminiscent of a decaying or buried living thing slightly peeking out of the ground like a zombie pushing a hand out of a gravesite. At the time, the idea was to take a pristine, mass-produced chair and transform it into something more horrendous that challenged the user and made them think about the lifespan of their objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, I look back on this piece with a sigh and a salute. The “fuck IKEA” was never meant to be a “fuck you, IKEA,” it was more of an exclamation and a call for more honest opinions about inanimate objects. We wanted to give more intention to the objects we surround ourselves with as if they are a pet or a companion, things that will outlive us. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In reality, I actually love IKEA. I even wrote my Art History thesis on IKEA (a year after the fuck IKEA project), in which I discussed where IKEA fit into the decorative arts canon, and the ways the West uses design to give meaning to their lives. I think of  IKEA showrooms where you can try on different interior identities like The Sims. I don't believe design can change the world, but I do think it should be fun at least.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> You also mentioned that you tend to make industrial design about industrial design. How does this project fit into your larger body of work, interests and preoccupations with material, manufacturing, form etc.?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> I do try to make work that is critical of itself. I’ve also been sure to critique industrial design as a whole by trying to make work informed by its environment. But I have also made work that is about aging and the body, even a project about death and AI. I try to use my work as a way of engaging with material, practice, and ecosystems while sneaking around under the guise of a friendly designer. In other words, I have made an effort to make a wide range of things to prove that design and its language can be a performance too. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming to this discipline  as a sculptor and researcher, I continue to  see design as an outsider. While I can now say that I am a multidisciplinary designer, I am still at my roots an American artist, making work “about” something. In a similar way that my chair projects have dealt with design itself, my current work with future ecologies and post-industrial studies seeks to critique the way that mass manufacturing has created a system built on infinite growth and extraction that will eventually cave in on itself. 
				</p>
				<p>
					So in many ways, the fuck IKEA project was a harbinger of what was to come. It was a realization that the ways we have stolen, used, and disposed of land and resources have landed us in a place of disbelief. My body of work is concerned with material, manufacturing, and form, and how these are all ingrained in our soil, our water, our DNA, and how a shifting of value systems and a little imagination can go a long way. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of my relationship with the industry and other makers, I hope to find my place as a designer with an affection toward conceptual art and research. I work with more artists than designers, but feel comfortable in a room talking to either. I hope to develop a practice that has both a functional and conceptual sect, both existing at the trade shows and the gallery. If I could exist somewhere in between I would be happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> What’s your favorite chair designed by someone else?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> I think my favorite chair is <span class="hover interview-text-highlight" onclick="openPopup('sesc-pompeia')"><em>Sesc Pompeia</em></span> by Lina Bo Bardi. The darkness and simplicity is so haunting and connected to its materiality that it really exerts itself. The little notch at the top is so cute and the darkness reminds me of being alone in a forest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> What are you reading, watching, thinking about these days?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> Right now, I’m reading “<em>The Wind Up Bird Chronicle</em>” by Haruki Murakami which is both heart-wrenchingly depressing and incredibly addicting. It’s worth a read, if you dare. I am also currently reading “<em>How to Make a Chair From a Tree</em>” by Jennie Alexander. The author, who sadly passed away recently, is a trans woman woodworker who pioneered the <em>two-slat post-and-rung shaving chair</em>. It’s a very wholesome read, even if you’re not planning on making a chair from a tree.
