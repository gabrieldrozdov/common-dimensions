				<p class="interview-text-content-lead">
					In fall 2023, we visited artist, architect, and educator Markus Berger at the Repair Atelier, an art/design workshop in Providence, RI that investigates and activates ideas of reuse. The Repair Atelier was created by Markus as a collaborative space for rethinking and reusing discarded and broken objects with the goal of transforming not just the objects themselves but also the communities that form around them. 				
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> The first time we visited you here at the workshop, we noticed those two chair skeletons hanging at the back of the room. While they’re deconstructed into individual parts, they’re still somehow recognizable as chairs. The way they’re arranged and mounted on these boards also makes them look uncannily like human skeletons. What are these objects? How did they come to be?

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> These pieces were made at the very beginning when I first decided I didn’t want to work with buildings (and contractors, budgets, and clients) anymore, but instead wanted to pursue my own self-directed work. They came out of an investigative process to figure out how to take abandoned objects, thrown-away objects, and give them a new life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the process of repairing a broken wooden chair, I first unmake the chair in order to clean all the joints before putting them back together again. I was trying to do this with this one particular chair, and within this process of disassembly, I arranged all of the pieces very nicely on a table in my workshop.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The next day, when I walked back into the workshop, I imagined seeing parts of a body. I was kind of set back at first, but then I saw this opportunity—I discovered within these fragments of a chair that there is this resemblance of body parts. From there, I started rearranging the pieces in different ways and generating “divergent beings.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Something that’s been important to me for some time, even prior to starting the Repair Atelier, was the idea of finding and breaking boundaries between (false) separations within art and design fields. Since I started teaching at RISD, I’ve been interested in breaking boundaries between art and design, breaking boundaries when it comes to what architecture should do (and certainly also what interior architecture should do). I’m also interested in breaking cultural boundaries, normative boundaries etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					So when I saw these pieces of a chair lying on that table, I saw that they somehow “speak” chair, yet they are not “chair.” They bring up this ambiguity that I love to play and also teach with—an ambiguity that makes unclear what an object was and is, a blurring of its boundaries.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> I think these skeleton-like objects, these “divergent beings,” are quite interesting formally in that they contain within them a tension between an object (a chair) and the human body. They are chairs, but they feel human. And looking at them almost feels like looking at a head, arms, a body. They’re compelling, strange-looking objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> Part of this has to do with the way I arranged them. The skeletal arrangement exacerbates that. Maybe this was not necessary, and maybe I should think about removing or distorting them a little because it’s possible that the body is almost too literally involved here. That said, their human form was very important to me when I started this entire process.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> When did you make these? 

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> I originally made these in 2017 for an exhibition called “Remaking.” This was before my work was really focused on the concept of repair. At this time, there was a dean of Graduate Studies at RISD called Patty Phillips—she was a fantastic academic dean who brought artists and academics together to discuss this show at the <em>finissage</em>. During one of our conversations, she brought up the topic of “re-pairing” and the idea that repair is somehow about bringing things together again. This was, for me, the starting point of focusing my work and thinking on processes of repair, reparative thinking, and reparative practices as they’re now laid out in the book I worked on with Kate Irvin (head curator of textiles in the RISD Museum of Art).

				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> This leads to a question we have about the other chair objects here in the space. While most have the familiar form of chair-ness, many have been made unfamiliar through some sort of formal and material intervention. I see chair collages, chairs with holes drilled into them, chairs whose parts have been deconstructed and rearranged etc. You call these chairs “repaired objects,” which implies they were broken and have somehow been “fixed.” Can you share more about this ongoing project, and the philosophy that informs it? 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MARKUS:</strong> One thing I’m interested in is finding meaning and aesthetic value in the wounds, in the brokenness of things. I’m interested in seeing brokenness not as a bad thing that one has to fix, but in understanding brokenness as something that we can find potential in. Brokenness can bring us to a conclusion of our own self-being, both personally and as a society. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was trained as an architect and worked in the context and mindset of typical 20th-century architecture. This was a world that aimed for “perfection” and held no space for the idea of brokenness. The dominant mentality was that as soon as something was broken, we had either to fix it (i.e. bring it back to the way it was when it was new), or throw it away. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When I was studying architecture in Vienna, I remember looking at and thinking about all the pristine new architecture around me. I was surrounded by beautiful buildings. But when it came to my own living space, and the bars and cafes I liked to go to, I realized I preferred the old ones, the shabby ones, the ones with smoky ceilings and broken objects. I liked the used furniture, not the new, fancy, glossy stuff.
				</p>	
				<p>
					This is when I started questioning the values and mentality of modern architecture. I realized that I no longer had an interest in fancy, shiny objects. I started consciously appreciating things that have a crack or a rip in them. Things that are visibly worn.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this time, fashion was also becoming aware of this idea of wear, and people were running around with distressed or torn jeans. But I was more interested in the real distress, not the kind of manipulated brokenness designed into new objects to make them appear old. I wanted to see the real wear that happens to things naturally over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few years ago, we had this wonderful colleague at RISD who is professor emeritus now called Yuriko Saito. She’s a philosopher who wrote a lot about the aesthetic of the imperfect. In the aesthetic of the imperfect Yuriko challenges the pursuit of flawless and standardized beauty, suggesting that there is a rich aesthetic experience to be found in the irregular and the incomplete. She prompts in her writing a reconsideration of our aesthetic values and invites us to find beauty in the often-overlooked aspects of the world around us. I learned a lot through conversations with her about how we look at the environment and the things we make.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Western obsession with the new and the shiny is not just a visual and philosophical problem, it’s also a material one. This way of thinking (this obsession with perfection and neglect of the things that already exist) is a large cause of all the trash that accumulates around us and that we export to the Global South. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Having worked and lived in places like Karachi, Pakistan, I have seen the effects of our 20th-century values and industrial achievements first-hand. These modernist ideals have benefitted a small part of the world’s population, but when you’re living in one of the countries that makes up the other larger part, you can actually see how these ideas and practices are questionable on a real, material level.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Many of my “repaired objects,” actively fight these modernist aesthetic values that I have been questioning for a long time.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In terms of my relationship with the industry and other makers, I hope to find my place as a designer with an affection toward conceptual art and research. I work with more artists than designers, but feel comfortable in a room talking to either. I hope to develop a practice that has both a functional and conceptual sect, both existing at the trade shows and the gallery. If I could exist somewhere in between I would be happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> What’s your favorite chair designed by someone else?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> I think my favorite chair is <span class="hover interview-text-highlight" onclick="openPopup('sesc-pompeia')"><em>Sesc Pompeia</em></span> by Lina Bo Bardi. The darkness and simplicity is so haunting and connected to its materiality that it really exerts itself. The little notch at the top is so cute and the darkness reminds me of being alone in a forest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>CD:</strong> What are you reading, watching, thinking about these days?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>MAX:</strong> Right now, I’m reading “<em>The Wind Up Bird Chronicle</em>” by Haruki Murakami which is both heart-wrenchingly depressing and incredibly addicting. It’s worth a read, if you dare. I am also currently reading “<em>How to Make a Chair From a Tree</em>” by Jennie Alexander. The author, who sadly passed away recently, is a trans woman woodworker who pioneered the <em>two-slat post-and-rung shaving chair</em>. It’s a very wholesome read, even if you’re not planning on making a chair from a tree.

					Max is a writer, designer, and maker whose work flows between the various languages of function and the material ecologies of the post-industrial age. He received a BA in Art History and Sculpture from Trinity College in 2019 and a Masters of Industrial Design from Rhode Island School of Design in 2023. He also taught a course at RISD about radical applications of design in 2022, and has shown in exhibitions internationally. His work with invasive species was most recently shown in the 2023 Venice Design Biennial. He worked as a studio assistant at FOS/Studio Grotta Nuova in Copenhagen, an artist in residence with Simon Johns Studio in Quebec, and was most recently editor in chief at RISD’s “volume 1” publication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Max is currently working remotely as a designer for <em>Altimeter Design Group</em>,  and teaching an afterschool Design/Build program with DownCity Design. In his spare time, he is 1/6th of an artist collective called “BAC” which makes floating wetland installations, and also does <em>top secret invasive species recon</em> with his partner Erika for their Somerson Sustainability and Innovation Fellowship.
