<h2><strong>Design: Obstacle for/to the Removal of Obstacles<br>(The Shape of Things)</strong></h2>
<h3>Vilém Flusser, 1993</h3>

<p>An ‘object’ is what gets in the way, a problem thrown in your path like a projectile (coming as it does from the Latin ob-iectum, Greek problema). The world is objective, substantial, problematic as long as it obstructs. An ‘<span data-keyword="Object of use">object of use</span>’ is an object which one uses and needs to get other objects out of the way. This definition contains within it a contradiction: an <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacle</span> for/to the removal of <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span>? This contradiction is what is called the ‘internal dialectic of culture’ (if by ‘culture’ we mean the totality of all <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>). This dialectic can be summed up as follows: I come across <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span> in my path (come across the objective, substantial, problematic world); I overturn some of these <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span> (transform them into <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>, into culture) in order to continue, and the objects thus overturned prove to be <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span> in themselves. The more I continue, the more I am obstructed by <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> (more in the form of cars and administrative machinery than in the form of hailstones and man-eating tigers). And I am in fact doubly obstructed: first, because I use them in order to continue, and second, because they get in my way. To put it another way: The more I continue, the more objective, substantial and problematic culture becomes.</p>
<p>This by way of an introduction—to the state of things as it were. In the case of <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>, it is therefore possible to ask how and why these projectiles have been thrown into one’s path. (In the case of other objects, such a question is pointless.) And the answer to the question is: They were projected as designs on the part of people who went before. They are projected designs that I need in order to continue and that obstruct me from continuing. In an attempt to break out of this vicious circle, I project designs myself: I myself throw <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> into the path of other people. What form must I give these projected designs so that those coming after me can use them to help them to continue and at the same time avoid being obstructed as much as possible? This is both a political and an aesthetic question and forms the central concern when it comes to creating things.</p>
<p>The question can also be formulated along different lines. In the case of <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>, I come across designs projected by other people. (In the case of other objects, I come across something different, perhaps something quite Other.) <span data-keyword="Object of use">Objects of use</span> are therefore mediations (media) between myself and other people, not just objects. They are not just objective but inter-subjective as well, not just problematic but dialogic as well. The question about creating things can also be formulated in this way: Can I give form to my projected designs in such a way that the communicative, the inter-subjective, the dialogic are more strongly emphasized than the objective, the substantial and the problematic?</p>
<p>When it comes to creating things, one is faced with the question of responsibility (and thus with freedom). Faced with freedom, naturally. Whoever projects designs for <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> (whoever produces culture) throws <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span> in other people’s way, and nothing can be done about this (not even for example one’s intention to promote emancipation). But the fact must be borne in mind that when it comes to creating things, one is faced with the question of responsibility, and this is what makes it possible to talk of freedom in relation to culture in the first place. Responsibility is the decision to answer for things to other people. It is openness to other people. If I decide to answer for something in creating my design, then in the <span data-keyword="Object of use">object of use</span> designed by me I emphasize the inter-subjective and not the objective. And the more I direct attention towards the object in the creation of my design (the more irresponsibly I design it), the more the object will obstruct those coming after me, and the area for manoeuvre in the culture will shrink. A glance at the current situation of culture is evidence of this: It is characterized by <span data-keyword="Object of use"></span>objects of use</p> whose designs were created irresponsibly, with attention directed towards the object. This is almost inevitable in the current situation (and has been since the Renaissance at least). At least since that time, those doing the designing have been people who have projected their designs onto objects so as to produce more and more useful <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>. The objects resist these designs. This opposition seizes the attention of those creating the designs, making it possible for them to penetrate more and more deeply into the objective, substantial, problematic world, to become more and more familiar with it and to master it. This makes scientific and technical progress possible. This progress has such a hold that those creating designs meanwhile forget that other progress, progress in the approach to other people. Scientific and technical progress has such a hold that any act of creating designs responsibly is thought to be a backward step. The current situation of culture is as it is precisely because creating designs responsibly is thought to be backward-looking.</p>
<p>The prophets called this hold over us on the part of the objective world ‘pagan, and <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> that have a hold over people as objects they called ‘idols’. From their perspective, the current situation of culture is characterized by idolatry. There are, however, indications that this attitude towards creating designs is starting to change. Such that designs are becoming less and less ‘pagan’ and more and more ‘prophetic’. In fact, one is starting to free the term object from the term material and to design immaterial <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> such as computer programs and communications networks. This is not to say that an ‘immaterial culture’ beginning to grow in this way would be less obstructive: It probably restricts freedom even more than the material one. But in creating such immaterial designs, the point of view of those creating the designs is, as it were, spontaneously directed towards other people. It is instructed by the immaterial itself about how to create designs responsibly. Immaterial <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> are idols (and thus worshipped), but they are transparent idols and make it possible for other people to see what is going on behind the scenes. Their mediated, inter-subjective, dialogic side is visible.</p>
<p>This is of course not enough of a reason to hope for a more responsible culture in the future. But there is an additional point to mention that may justify such optimism. <span data-keyword="Object of use">Objects of use</span> are after all obstructions that I need in order to progress, and the more I need them, the more I use them up. Used <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> are those for which the design projecting them into one’s path has been obliterated. They have lost the form projected upon them by design; they are de-formed and thrown away.</p>
<p>This can be traced back to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all material tends to lose its form (its information). This principle does not hold any less well (if less impressively) in the case of immaterial <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>: They too are on the road to entropy. We are beginning to become conscious of the temporal nature of all forms (and thus of all creation). Since entropy is beginning to obstruct us at least as much as <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> are. The question of responsibility and freedom (this being the essential question of creation) arises not only in the process of designing but also in the process of throwing away <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span>. It may be that consciousness of the temporality of all creation (even that of immaterial designs) will contribute to a future situation in which things will be designed a bit more responsibly, resulting in a culture with less and less room for <span data-keyword="Object of use">objects of use</span> to act as <span data-keyword="Obstacle">obstacles</span> and more and more room for them to serve as vehicles for interpersonal contact. A culture with a bit more freedom.</p>
