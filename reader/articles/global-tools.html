<p>The <span data-keyword="Body">body</span></p>
<p>The human <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> analyzed prior to the definition of <span data-keyword="Functional">functional</span> ends, prior to the action of cultural filters, prior to constraint inside the rigidity of systems.</p>
<p>The <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> as primary <span data-keyword="Tool">tool</span>. In conventional learning processes (ways through which to systematize experience through notions), the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> is seen as an impediment or in any case as a factor that can be overlooked, whose awareness of use can be neglected. The <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> in religion is experienced as a fault, while freeing ourselves of its physical nature becomes a goal.</p>
<p>In the process of de-intellectualized actions we can see the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> as a <span data-keyword="Tool">tool</span>, apart from a specific culture of the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>, simulating and retracing the process that leads progressively from discovery to recognition, to purposed and non-purposed use of one's <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>.</p>
<p>The cognitive result is not predictable, but can be determined a posteriori, after the operations; for example, cognitive processes of greater awareness can be triggered regarding the use and the purposed possibilities of one's <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>, through a negative use of that <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>.</p>
<p>Hypothesis of primary operative analysis.</p>
<p>The first phase of acquisition:</p>
<p>Recognition, analysis of one’s <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> as a constructed fact, as a list of parts, of possibilities of use in relation to space (elementary movements), to things. Survey of physical areas of influence in keeping with the five senses. Hypothesis: experiments of purposed and non-purposed activities, in combined absence of the various senses.</p>
<p>Use referring to elementary, primary needs: eating, sleeping. Use referred to complex needs. Use purposed for situations outside the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>. The <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> as basic equipment in relation to a non-primary purpose.</p>
<p>Exercise as a means to accustom the equipment, to refine it, conserve it, prepare it.</p>
<p>Magical use, not directly purposed. The use of the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> to penetrate reality outside the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span>, outside of causality. Inverse use; the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> used to increase the distance between self and objects, the <span data-keyword="Body">body</span> as container of the mind, as diaphragm, threshold.</p>
<p>The various phases are connected with technical research instrumentation that uses cognitive fields decontextualized as much as possible with respect to the culture of origin: mime, gymnastics, dance, dress, make-up.</p>
