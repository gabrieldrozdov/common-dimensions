<p>2° Waking: Techniques of <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span>. <span  data-keyword="Rest">Rest</span> can be perfect <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> or a mere suspension of activity: lying down, sitting, <span data-keyword="Squatting">squatting</span>, etc. Try <span data-keyword="Squatting">squatting</span>. You will realise the torture that a Moroccan meal, for example, eaten according to all the rituals, would cause you. The way of sitting down is fundamental. You can distinguish <span data-keyword="Squatting">squatting</span> mankind and sitting mankind. And, in the latter, people with benches and people without benches and daises; people with chairs and people without chairs. Wooden chairs supported by crouching figures are widespread, curiously enough, in all the regions at fifteen degrees of latitude North and along the Equator in both continents. There are people who have tables and people who do not. The table, the Greek 'trapeza', is far from universal. Normally it is still a carpet, a mat, throughout the East. This is all complicated, for these forms of <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> include meals, conversation, etc. Certain societies take their <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> in very peculiar positions. Thus, the whole of Nilotic Africa and part of the Chad region, all the way to Tanganyika, is populated by men who <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> in the fields like storks.</p>
<p>Some manage to <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> on one foot without a pole, others lean on a stick.</p>
<p>These <span  data-keyword="Rest">resting</span> techniques form real characteristics of civilisations, common to a large number of them, to whole families of peoples. Nothing seems more natural to the psychologists; I do not know if they would quite agree with me, but I believe that these postures in the savannah are due to the height of the grasses there and the functions of shepherd or sentry, etc.; they are laboriously acquired by education and preserved.
You have active, generally aesthetic <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span>; thus even dancing at <span  data-keyword="Rest">rest</span> is frequent, etc. I shall return to this.</p>
