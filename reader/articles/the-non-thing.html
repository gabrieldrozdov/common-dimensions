<h2><strong>The Non-Thing 1</strong></h2>
<h3>CITATION GOES HERE</h3>
<p>Until recently, our environment consisted of things: houses and furniture, machines and motor vehicles, clothing and underwear, books and pictures, tins and cigarettes. There were also people in our environment, but science had largely made them into objects: Like all other things, they are measurable, quantifiable and easily manipulated. In short, the environment was the condition in which we existed. Finding our way around it was the same thing as distinguishing ourselves from artificial objects. No easy task. Is this ivy on the wall of my house a natural thing because it is growing and because botany, a branch of science, is concerned with it? Or is it an artificial thing because my gardener planted it in keeping with an aesthetic model? And is my house an artificial thing because designing and building houses is an art, or is it natural for people to live in houses just as it is for birds to live in nests? Is there any sense at all in wanting to distinguish between nature and <span data-keyword="Culture">culture</span> when it comes to finding your way around the world of things? Should one not resort to other ‘ontological’ criteria - for example, by distinguishing immovable from movable things, apartments from appurtenances? This too creates difficulties. A country would appear to be an immovable thing, but Poland has moved further west. A bed would appear to be movable, but my bed has moved less than Poland has. Any catalogue of the world of things, whatever criteria are used to set it up - e.g. ‘animate-inanimate’, ‘mine-yours’, ‘useful-useless’, ‘near-far’ - is bound to have grey areas and gaps. It is no easy matter knowing your way around things.</p>
<p>And yet, as we are acknowledging with hindsight, it was rather cosy living in a world of things. Of course, one did have what could be called epistemological difficulties, but one knew more or less what one needed to do in order to be able to live. ‘To live’ means to proceed towards death. On the way, one came across things that blocked one’s path. These things called <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> had therefore to be removed. ‘To live’ then meant: to resolve <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> in order to be able to die. And one resolved <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> either by transforming intractable things into manageable ones - this was called ‘production’ - or by overcoming them - this was called ‘progress’. Until eventually, one came up against <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> that could not be transformed or overcome. These were called ‘last things’, and one died of them. This was the paradox of living surrounded by things: One thought one had to resolve <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> so as to clear the way to death, so as to ‘escape from circumstances’, and it was the unresolved <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span> one died of. This does not sound very pleasant, but it is basically comforting. One knows what to hold on to in life - i.e. things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this has changed. <span data-keyword="Non-Things">Non-things</span> now flood our environment from all directions, displacing things. These <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span> are called ‘information’. ‘What nonsense,’ one is tempted to say. There has always been information, and, as for the meaning of the word in-formation, it has to do with ‘form in’ things. All things contain information: books and pictures, tins and cigarettes. One has only to read things, ‘decode’ them, to bring the information into the open. It has always been like that; there is nothing new in it.</p>
<p>This objection is totally without substance. The information that now floods our environment displacing the things in it is of a kind that has never existed before: It is immaterial information. The electronic pictures on the television screen, the data stored in computers, all the reels of film and microfilm, holograms and programs, are such ‘soft’ ware that any attempt to grasp them is bound to fail. These <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span> are, in the true sense of the expression, ‘impossible to get hold of’. They are only open to decoding. Of course, as with old-style information, they also appear to be inscribed within things: in cathode-ray tubes, celluloid, micro-chips, laser beams. But although this sounds ‘ontological’, it is an ‘existential’ illusion. The material basis of new-style information is negligible from the existential point of view. Evidence in support of this is the fact that hardware is getting cheaper and cheaper and software more and more expensive. The vestiges of materiality still adhering to these <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span> can be discounted by looking at the new environment. The environment is becoming ever softer, more nebulous, more ghostly, and to find one’s way around it one has to take this spectral nature as a starting-point.</p>
<p>But it is not even necessary to be fully conscious of the new nature of our environment. We are all imbued with it. Our existential concerns are shifting before our very eyes from things to information. We are less and less concerned with possessing things and more and more concerned with consuming information. Not just another piece of furniture or article of clothing but another holiday trip, an even better school for our children, another music festival - these are what we want. Things start to recede into the background of our area of concern. At the same time, a larger and larger section of society is engaged in the production of information, of ‘services’, of management, of systems, and a smaller and smaller section is involved in producing things. The working classes, those producers of things, are becoming a minority, and managers and apparatchiks, those producers of <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span>, form the majority. Bourgeois morality based on things: The production, accumulation and consumption of things give way to something new. Life in an environment that is becoming immaterial takes on a new complexion.</p>
<p>One can object to this picture of change on the grounds that it does not take into account the mountain of junk accompanying the advent of <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span>. This objection is without foundation: The junk proves the demise of things. What is happening is that we feed information into machines so that they spew out such junk in huge quantities and for next to no cost. This throw-away material, all those lighters, razors, pens, plastic bottles, are not true things; one cannot hold on to them. And just as we get better and better at learning how to feed information into machines, all things will be transformed into the same kind of junk, even houses and pictures. All things will lose their value, and all values will be transformed into information. ‘Revaluation of all values’. This is also by way of a definition of the new imperialism: Humanity is becoming dominated by those groups who have control over information, be it the construction of atomic power stations and weapons, aeroplanes and motor vehicles, or genetic engineering and management systems. Such groups sell this information at inflated prices to a dominated humanity.</p>
<p>That which is happening before our very eyes, this displacement of things to the outer limits of our concern and this focus of our concerns on information - is without precedent in history. So it is very unsettling. If we wish to find our way around it, despite the lack of precedents, we must look for some parallel. Otherwise, how are we supposed to try and imagine how we shall have to live in such an immaterial world? What will a human being be like who is not concerned with things, but with information, symbols, codes, and models? There is one parallel: the first Industrial Revolution. At that time, concerns shifted from animate nature, cows and horses, farmers and artisans to things: machines, the products of machines, the laboring masses and capital, and so arose the ‘modern’ world that was, until very recently, the norm. At that time, one could claim with some justification that a farmer in 1750 BC had more in common with a farmer in AD 1750 than the latter had with an industrial worker, albeit his son, in 1780. Something similar is true again today. We are closer to a worker or citizen of the time of the French Revolution than to our children - yes, those children playing with electronic gadgets. Of course, this parallel may not make the current revolution any less unsettling, but it may help us to get a hold on things.</p>
<p>We will in fact come to realize that our attempt to get hold of things in life is not exactly the rational modus vivendi we were inclined to think it was, but that our ‘objectivity’ is something relatively recent. We will come to realize that one can also live differently: perhaps better even. Besides, ‘modern’ life, life surrounded by things, is not the absolute paradise our ancestors perhaps thought it might be. Many non-Western societies in the Third World have good reason to reject it. If our children too are starting to reject it, this is not necessarily cause for despair. On the contrary, we must try and imagine this new life surrounded by <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is no easy task. This new human being in the process of being born all around us and within us is in fact without hands. He does not handle things anymore, so in his case one cannot speak of actions anymore. Nor of practice, nor of work for that matter. The only things left of his hands are the tips of his fingers, which he uses to tap on keys so as to play with symbols. The new human being is not a man of action anymore but a player: homo ludens as opposed to homo faber. Life is no longer a drama for him but a performance. It is no longer a question of action but of sensation. The new human being does not wish to do or to have but to experience. He wishes to experience, to know and, above all, to enjoy. As he is no longer concerned with things, he has no <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span>. Instead, he has programs. And yet he is still a human being: He will die, and he knows it. We die of things like unresolved <span data-keyword="Problem">problems</span>; he will die of <span data-keyword="Non-Things">non-things</span> like program errors. If we think of him along these lines, he comes closer to us. The advent of the non-thing in our environment is a radical change, but he will not be able to alter the basic mode of existence, being unto death. Whether death is seen as the last thing or as a non-thing.</p>
