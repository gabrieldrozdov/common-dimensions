<p>3. Classification of techniques of the body according to efficiency</p>
<p>The techniques of the body can be classified according to their <span data-keyword="Efficiency">efficiency</span>, i.e. according to the results of training. Training, like the assembly of a machine, is the search for, the acquisition of an <span data-keyword="Efficiency">efficiency</span>. Here it is a human <span data-keyword="Efficiency">efficiency</span>. These techniques are thus human norms of human training. These procedures that we apply to animals men voluntarily apply to themselves and to their children. The latter are probably the first beings to have been trained in this way, before all the animals, which first had to be tamed. As a result I could to a certain extent compare these techniques, them and their transmission, to training systems, and rank them in the order of their effectiveness.</p>
<p>This is the place for the notion of dexterity, so important in psychology, as well as in sociology. But in French we only have the poor term ‘habile' which is a bad translation of the Latin word ‘habilis', far better designating those people with a sense of the adaptation of all their well-co-ordinated movements to a goal, who are practised, who 'know what they are up to'. The English notions of 'craft' or 'cleverness' (skill, presence of mind and habit combined) imply competence at something. Once again we are clearly in the technical domain.</p>
