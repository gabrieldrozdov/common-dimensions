<h2><strong>Comment By Enzo Mari On The “Proposta Per Una Autoprogeitazione”, Enzo Mari, 1983
</strong></h2>
<p>After the production of the Day-night Sofa and other similar attempts, I am in a state of great depression because I have come into first-hand contact with the naivety of the approach to the low-cost, well-designed object; the outcome is completely bankrupt and the audience to whom these items are directed rejects them because they do not recognise them as part of the cultural system. When I talk about the audience, I'm also referring to young students or militant <span data-keyword="Work">workers</span>, in addition to the political leaders of the groups of the new left, that is, to that section of the audience that clearly develops research and criticism, although limited to the fundamentals of structural relationships. I ask myself how it is possible to change the state of things. How is it possible to implement the deconditioning of form as a value and not strictly corresponding to content? The only way I know of, in that it belongs to my reality, is that it becomes possible only when critical thinking is based on the practice of <span data-keyword="Work">work</span>.</p>
<p>The way should therefore be to involve the user of a consumer item in its design and creation. The only possible way to start being free from such deeply rooted conditioning is by actually touching the different contradictions of the <span data-keyword="Work">work</span>. But how is it possible to expect such an effort when they lack the production tools and, above all, the technical competence and culture that would take quite a long time to acquire? On the other hand, if this were indeed possible, anyone who needed a table, for example, could pick up the essential skills needed to make a table, for example, that the legs need to be attached firmly to the surface. They could, therefore, when making a purchase, evaluate the models that most closely match their technical requirements and according to quality of construction, without entering into the merits of style or taste from the vast selection of objects on sale.</p>
<p>In terms of production tools, it was important to choose ones that already belonged to the community, not these that were easy to get hold of; almost everyone has a hammer and almost everyone has tried banging in a few nails at least once. Regarding material, the easiest to acquire remains the wooden plank.</p>
<p>Technical culture is a more difficult context, but there is an example of technical culture that is theoretically available to all, even though it is used only by manual <span data-keyword="Work">workers</span>. The technique of the carpenter and, I want to be clear, not that of the cabinetmaker; it is reduced to the minimum and is hardly ever taught. It is basically frames, <span data-keyword="Work">worktables</span>, or whatever, based on very simple principles which are ultimately the basic elements of engineering and architecture.</p>
<p>The beam and the pillar. The joining of the beam to the pillar is done using nails, and because nailing is a kind of joint that does not guarantee complete steadiness, you need to strengthen the joint with a nailed diagonal element. The result is a construction based on the triangle, which, again, is one of the fundamental elements of engineering: the triangle cannot be deformed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the economics of the carpenter's <span data-keyword="Work">work</span> implies the total recoup of the material used for a certain construction, he soon gets used to using diagonal strengthening elements with a minimum of waste.</p>
<p>As I said, the technique is easily picked up because once you have nailed a beam between a couple of pillars, you add some transversal elements to guarantee solidity.</p>
<p>Starting from these two choices, tools and techniques, my young assistants and I tried making a series of objects, tables, benches, chairs and beds using this technique, in the sense that the objects were not designed beforehand but we gave shape to them by putting several small planks together, juxtaposing the minimum of planks necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, we did not concern ourselves with perfecting the outcome in the sense that the only conditions of judgement for all the models made was their robustness instead of savings on the materials used, and we worried even less about the lucubrations of formal ratios.</p>
<p>These models were collected together in a small book which was distributed in various ways, the final one was to send it to anyone who asked for it without cost.</p>
<p>The proposal was for people to be stimulated by the examples shown to make what they needed, including other models that were not in the book and to make them freely, taking the proposed example simply as a suggestion, not as a model to copy.</p>
<p>Our idea was met with great success and I received thousands of requests, so much that the book had to be reprinted. But, once again, the <span data-keyword="Work">work</span> hypothesis fails given that the proposal is either not understood or understood differently 998 of the time.</p>
<p>The project was clearly only intender as a practical critical exercise. Obviously, objects must be produced using <span data-keyword="Machine">machinery</span> and the latest <span data-keyword="Technology">technology</span>. This is the only way to get good quality and economical items.</p>
<p><span data-keyword="Machine">Machinery</span> theoretically frees man from <span data-keyword="Work">work</span>, and Socialism itself is born and can exist because industrial <span data-keyword="Machine">machinery</span> exists. It is clear that the models proposed were completely uneconomical from this point of view: to give an example, a table, made properly by <span data-keyword="Machine">machine</span>, needs no more than 30% of the material used in our models, with much more stable and long-lasting results. It is crucial to socialise the implications of modern <span data-keyword="Technology">technology</span>, and this ought to be done by really making the best use of <span data-keyword="Technology">technology</span> and not proposing the use of an archaic <span data-keyword="Technology">technology</span>.</p>
<p><span data-keyword="Wood">Wood</span> should be used only where it is cheaper than other materials. Additionally, the use of <span data-keyword="Wood">wood</span> should not be a way of re-proposing a material from an ancient tradition in the place of modern materials such as plastic, which is better suited to real production standards. In fact, when taken from this point of view, all projects using a natural material like <span data-keyword="Wood">wood</span> tend to be reactionary.</p>
<p>I was aware of these things and I tried to tell them: it was simply a matter of using this material and only possible way of carrying out the design exercise.</p>
<p>Objections were raised and I was accused of attempting a return to nature, of a Manichaean dislike of <span data-keyword="Machine">machinery</span>, in the sense that I was accused of confusing existing production ratios of the <span data-keyword="Machine">machine</span> and not the positive potential of the <span data-keyword="Machine">machine</span> itself. A further objection was that I was encouraging the hobby and do-it-yourself phenomenon, but these are clearly always restrictive, a petty bourgeois metaphor for the acquisition of technical cultures. In fact, most people who asked for the book did so to:</p>
<p></p>— satisfy the needs of a trend that was beginning at the time and for which I provided a perfect alibi, that of the «poor» <span data-keyword="Wood">wooden</span> object, the pseudo-artisan object, the naive object symbolic of a return to nature;</p>
<p>— to resolve the real furnishing problems of young students or the like who simply want to be able to make what they need, spending as little as possible in the process;</p>
<p> text-indent: 20px— to furnish the country home, or second home, in a rustic style, etc; only a very small group, 1 or 2% understood the meaning of the experiment.</p>
