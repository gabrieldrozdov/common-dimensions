<h2><strong>The Lever Strikes Back</strong><br>(The Shape of Things)</h2>
<h3>Vilém Flusser, 1993</h3>
<p>Machines are simulated organs of the human body. The <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span>, for example, is an extended arm. It increases the ability of the arm to lift and ignores all the other functions the arm has. It is more ‘stupid’ than the arm, but it therefore reaches further and lifts heavier loads.</p>
<p>Stone blades - made like carnassial teeth - are amongst the oldest machines. They are older than homo sapiens sapiens, and they can still tear today: because they are not in fact organic but made of stone. Paleolithic man probably also had living machines: jackals, for example, which he made use of in hunting as extended legs and carnassial teeth. As carnassial teeth, jackals are less stupid than stone blades; therefore stone blades are more durable. This may be one reason why both ‘non-organic’ and organic machines were used right up to the Industrial Revolution: knives as well as jackals, <span data-keyword="Lever">levers</span> as well as donkeys, shovels as well as slaves. So as to be able to make use of the durability of one as well as the intelligence of the other. But ‘intelligent’ machines (jackals, donkeys and slaves) are structurally more complicated than ‘stupid’ ones. That is the reason why, since the Industrial Revolution, we have started to dispense with them.</p>
<p>The industrial machine differs from a pre-industrial one in that it is based on a scientific theory. Of course, the pre-industrial <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span> has a gut feeling about the principle of the <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span>, but only with the industrial <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span> does it know what it is about. This is usually expressed in the following way: Pre-industrial machines are empirical; industrial ones are produced by technology. At the time of the Industrial Revolution, science had a series of theories concerning the ‘non-organic’ world at its disposal - in particular, theories of mechanics. But when it came to the organic world, it had few ideas about theories. What kind of gut feeling a donkey might have had about laws was a mystery not only to the donkey but to the scientists as well. Thus, since the Industrial Revolution, the ox has given way to the locomotive and the horse to the aeroplane. The ox and the horse cannot be produced by technology. As far as slaves were concerned, it was a more complicated business. Technological machines became not only more and more efficient but bigger and more expensive as well. For this reason, the ‘Man/machine’ relationship was reversed, and Man did not use machines anymore but was used by them. He became a relatively intelligent slave of relatively stupid machines.</p>
<p>In our century, this has changed a bit. Theories have become more sophisticated, and thus machines have become more and more efficient and at the same time smaller and, above all, more ‘intelligent’. Slaves have become more and more superfluous and have sought refuge from machines in the service sector or have become unemployed. These are the familiar results of the automation and ‘robotization’ characteristic of what is happening in post-industrial society. But this is not the change that really matters. What is rather more important is the fact that theories are beginning to be available for possible application to the organic world as well. We are beginning to find out which laws govern the donkey’s gut feeling. So in the future, technology will be able to produce oxen, horses, slaves and super-slaves. This might be called the second or ‘biological’ Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will become apparent that the attempt to build ‘intelligent, non-organic’ machines is at best a makeshift, and at worst a mistake; a <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span> does not have to be a stupid arm if it is built into a central nervous system. The high level of intelligence of the ox can even be surpassed by locomotives built fully in accordance with ‘biological’ principles. The durability of the ‘non-organic’ can be combined with the intelligence of the organic in the future construction of machines. Soon the place will be crawling with stone jackals.</p>
<p>But this is not necessarily an ideal situation: to be crawling with stone jackals, oxen, slaves and super-slaves at the same time as we are trying to eat and digest the industrial by-products poured out by them. This cannot be allowed. Not only, in fact, because these ‘stone intelligences’ are becoming increasingly more intelligent and therefore not stupid enough to serve us. This cannot be because machines already strike back at us even when they are stupid. How much more will they strike back when they have become smarter?</p>
<p>The old <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span> is striking back at us: We have been moving our arms as though they were <span data-keyword="Lever">levers</span> since we have had <span data-keyword="Lever">levers</span>. We simulate that which we have simulated. Since we have been pastoralists we have behaved like herds of sheep and have needed pastors. This striking back on the part of machines is now becoming clear for all to see: young people dancing like robots, politicians making decisions based on computerized scenarios, scientists thinking digitally, and artists using plotters. Consequently, the fact that the <span data-keyword="Lever">lever</span> is striking back will have to be taken into account in the future construction of machines. It is not enough simply to take the economy and ecology into consideration in the construction of machines. We will have to think about the ways in which such machines may strike back at us. A difficult thing to do considering that most machines nowadays are made by ‘intelligent machines’ and that we ourselves only look on from the side-lines, as it were, intervening only occasionally.</p>
<p>This is a problem of design: What should machines be like if their striking back is not to cause us pain? Or, better still: if it is to do us some good? What should the stone jackals be like if they are not to tear us apart and if we ourselves are not to behave like jackals? Naturally, we can design them in such a way that they lick us instead of biting us. But do we really want to be licked? These are difficult questions because nobody really knows what they want to be like. However, these issues need to be addressed before one can start to design stone jackals (or mollusc clones or bacterial chimeras for that matter). And these issues are more interesting than future stone jackals and supermen. Are designers ready to address them?"</p>
