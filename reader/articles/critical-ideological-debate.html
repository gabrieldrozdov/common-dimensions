<h2><strong>A critical-ideological debate between E. Mari and E. Facchinelli (in «L'erba voglio», n. 16)</strong></h2>
<h3>Enzo Mari, 1975</h3>
<p>E.F. When we first saw the designs for your furniture, we thought it was necessary to go through someone who would cut out and prepare thewood needed. We saw instead that there's no need for a middle man. The catalogue is the only thing you really need.</p>
<p>E.M. I actually tried to minimise any technical difficulties. I couldn't really ask people to start directly from the tree. Sawmills have been delivering wood cut to standard sizes for centuries, just like bricks from furnaces, for that matter.</p>
<p>So, I thought of these prefabricated boards in different sections which could very easily be adjusted to get the desired length.</p>
<p>The <span data-keyword="System">system</span> is simple not only because of the nail but also by the simplified cut of the saw. There are no diagonal or complex cuts, or anything needing joints. Besides, the simple orthogonal cuts don't even need to be well executed. Everything works just fine even if the struts are somewhat uneven, as you pointed out to me. It is in this sense that the project makes direct use of the prefab board; and therefore, with a few exceptions, each of the pieces is made using a single board section. This means you can buy the boards directly from sawmills or specialist shops (the most common length is four metres).</p>
<p>And, given the simplicity of the cuts, you can also ask that they be cut to measure for a small charge.</p>
<p>E.F. It is interesting that when we look at your designs, everyone assumes that there must be a kind of intermediary factory that will provide the ready-cut pieces.</p>
<p>We think we can't move forward with it if this factory isn't there, that the project can't be completed, etc... In short, the greatest difficulty in making these projects popular is likely <span data-keyword="Ideology">ideological</span>, there is a kind of prejudice that is deeply rooted in the division of labour and tasks, seem as an incapacity or impossibility to do certain things.</p>
<p>E.M. This is by no means an unimportant factor, in fact it touches on one of the reasons for this project. We tend to give specialist roles that are not our own a particular position, we say: this requires a special technology, culture or approach that precludes me.</p>
<p>And this is just an <span data-keyword="Ideology">ideological</span> approach, because if it is true that there are certain technical difficulties and that specific technical knowledge is required, what ought to be stressed is that the art of design (and I'm not only talking about my own sector here) is straight-forward and easy. It seems, or it is difficult for different, external, reasons, one of the first of which is that the space for the substance of a project is almost never allowed, only that for its appearance.</p>
<p>E.F. Another thing. To us, it seems as though these items you have designed stand, as objects, in contradiction to all other already existing objects, a table like this certainly becomes dominant, causing other tables to have an identity crisis, or certain types of things designed and built according to industrial models, it tends to immediately expel these things.</p>
<p>Do you think that this is of some significance?</p>

<p>E.M. These objects don't seem false to me, they aren't mystified.</p>

<p>But why aren't they? They are made using the same techniques used by carpenters for their work benches and scaffolding, the same goes for stage-set workers, it is a semi-spontaneous technique... the fact is though that this table stands properly, all the details announce their functions. This leg is a leg, this trellis underneath is a strengthening beam, the small strut under the boards of the table top is there to stop vibrations, the nails join the planks together. Having reduced the technique down to its reasons, to its most essential moments, that's what makes this an autonomous object.</p>
<p>E.F. But who will accept this table? Not many apparently, if the majority go with the <span data-keyword="Ideology">ideology</span> of the objects you intend to simplify and if the furniture industry is already in large part an <span data-keyword="Ideology">ideological</span> industry, or rather an industry that trades in objects that are loaded with imagery, which have <span data-keyword="Value">value</span> precisely because of the imagery they are loaded with, and of which a high price is a fundamental factor. Only those who are already living within a different framework will be able to accept it, those who have an idea of another space in which to live and operate.</p>
<p>E.M. People already aware of this world, those who read magazines…they will probably accept it. Others... in my experience with manual workers and with carpenters who made these models themselves, these people know how to appreciate the object as it is, but at the same time they tend to be afraid to actually use it, because using it implies a relationship with others, the fear of being judged... it is too unusual an object.</p>
<p>When you highlight the economics of the table, or rather its low cost, then rejection becomes even more direct, more immediate.</p>
<p>If this table costs less than all the others, people will be afraid of having to have something poor. When thinking of the home, there is always an expectation of a certain <span data-keyword="Status">status</span> which works on different levels…Then there are youngsters, students, some old ex-young students…</p>
<p>E.F. On the other hand, there is unquestionable research in these object that can be built using the simple technique that you have talked about.</p>
<p>E.M. This research was not so much a particular moment of mine. It was due more to the fact that I recognised myself in the models that I spoke about earlier, the work of the carpenter... in rediscovering the essentiality of that craft. It is an idea that I have already expressed, it is something that manual workers already have, at certain times, at least those who do not have direct contact with office culture. They already handle something independently that they don't know how to recognise as their own, precisely because they are conditioned by other models.</p>
<p>E.F. In what way is your work different from the American do it yourself?</p>

<p>E.M. My intention was for it to be the exact opposite. Then maybe it will be recovered, or perhaps it is nothing more than an aspect of the American model. Hobbies are nothing but a degradation of culture, it is doing something imitative, without proper knowledge of what you are doing, just to be able to say: I made it, just for fun.</p>
<p>Within every specific field, research is carried out which can only be experienced through direct experimentation. Anyway, it would be wrong to think of a return to Arcadia, to a world where everyone does everything with their own hands... industry exists and that's a positive thing, industry should be kept occupied, be managed, made use of, tools should not be rejected.. these objects are not intended as alternatives to industrial ones, their intent instead is to be a kind of critical exercise on design, and this is the reason why this project was called <span data-keyword="Self-Design">self-design</span>, not self-production. The user, in repeating the operation, which can never be a slavish repetition... the designs have no measurements and you can make changes, alterations while you are making them... when making the piece, the user becomes aware of the structural thinking behind the object itself, therefore, subsequently they. improve their own ability to evaluate objects on the market with a more critical eye.</p>
<p>You have already said that an object of this type tends to banish other objects from the room: this was precisely the kind of evaluation I wanted to achieve. The fact that it is a critical operation carried out on a simple table rather than what are, or what seem to be, more important issues, doesn't seem to be an important objection as far as I am concerned; what is important is the operation and the habit of the operation. And it is not insignificant that the operation starts not from the general, but from a specific situation and you experimentally acquire the specialist's legacy. In this sense, it is right to speak of manual skill, in the sense of direct, first-hand experience, not in the tactile sense of working with a natural material such as wood. It is a form of research and research can only be carried out through direct experience.</p>
<p>E.F. In this context, have you thought of the possibility of doing this exercise in schools, for example, where this way of critical learning through the direct use of materials, this direct appropriation of knowledge doesn't exist?</p>
<p>E.M. In general terms, of course. But to be more specific, I don't know whether kids in middle school are interested in this kind of object…I certainly wasn't thinking about tables at 13 or 14! The operation could be repeated only within the field of objects that fall directly within the interests of young people, otherwise it is just another way of stopping them from finding things out.</p>
