			Common Dimensions approaches the subject of the chair with genuine curiosity and naive enthusiasm. It begins with the question: what makes a chair a chair? Although the answer may seem obvious at first, the more one thinks about it, the less clear it becomes. Should a chair be defined as any object that can be sat on? If so, isn't a carpet a chair? What about a horse? One can sit on a horse, but most of us would agree that a horse is not a chair.
		</p>

			Most mass-produced chairs follow certain common dimensions. Seat distance from the ground, depth and width are determined by specifications that assume an “average” body in terms of height, weight, degree of mobility, and physical need. The chair is so closely linked to the human form that it shares its anatomical terms: back, legs, spine, feet, ears, knees, arms, seat. The chair is both an extension of and a support for our bodies—besides our clothes, it’s the design object most intimately connected to us most of the time. Chairs hold us up while we work, eat, travel, socialize, sleep.

			Chairs don’t just sustain the weight of our bodies, they also carry with them a considerable symbolic load.

			Chairs don’t just sustain the weight of our bodies, they're also burdened with heavy symbolic meaning. An empty chair can represent loss or absence, while a gilded chair may symbolize wealth or power. When Le Corbusier famously said “the chair is a machine for sitting”, he was privileging usefulness over aesthetic form. However, even this seemingly functionalist description is loaded with symbolism, suggesting the deep interconnectedness of the human body with the mechanical tools of industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Common Dimensions investigates the chair as a symbolic, discursive, and designed object, and explores its wide and varying expressions: the chair as architecture, the chair as status symbol, the chair as prosthesis, the chair as power, the chair as a tool, and so on. This project offers no clear definition of the chair as a singular, fixed object. Instead, it seeks to expand our understanding of (and connection to) chairs through a collection of interviews with artists, designers, and collectors, an ever-expanding visual library, and a growing database of texts that both contribute to and complicate the topic.
