			Common Dimensions is a research platform and print publication that approaches the subject of the chair by asking one deceptively obtuse question: what makes a chair a chair? Ought a chair be defined as any object one can sit on? If so, isn’t a carpet a chair? What about a horse? 		</p>
		<p>
			It is through such apparently naive lines of enquiry that this project explores the intertwined material, cultural, and political dimensions of the chair. This investigation is conducted through interviews, a collection of texts, and an expansive visual library that includes not just iconic chairs that reinforce the object’s position as a design meme, but also more politically loaded examples from Black Panther founder Huey Newton’s rattan throne to the class stratification exemplified by airline seating.		</p>
		<p>
			A chair can signify power, political affiliation, taste, and value in myriad ways. But in its simplest form, the chair is a utilitarian object, and one that’s intimately connected to the human body. Most mass-produced chairs follow certain common dimensions. Seat distance from the ground, depth and width are all determined by specifications that assume a so-called “average” body’s height, weight, degree of mobility, and physical needs. Indeed, the chair and the human form are so closely linked that they share an anatomical lexicon: back, legs, spine, feet, ears, knees, and arms. The chair is also both an extension of and a support for our bodies—besides our clothes, it’s perhaps the design object we are most intimately connected with. 		<p>
			Chairs don’t just support the weight of our bodies, they’re also weighted with symbolic meaning. An empty chair can represent loss or absence, while a gilded chair might evoke wealth or power. When Le Corbusier famously stated “the chair is a machine for sitting,” he was privileging usefulness over aesthetic form. However, even this seemingly functionalist distillation is symbolically loaded, positioning the chair as a sort of Fordist prosthetic designed to enhance worker efficiency. And while ergonomics may have revolutionized comfort in the workplace, even today’s high-tech office chairs embody questions about labour, class, taste, and power.
		</p>

		<p>
			Common Dimensions investigates the chair as a symbolic, discursive, and designed object in order to explore its broad and diverse expressions: the chair as architecture, the chair as status symbol, the chair as prosthesis, the chair as locus of power, the chair as a tool. This project offers no decisive definition of the chair as a singular, fixed object. Instead, it seeks to expand our understanding of (and connection to) chairs through a collection of interviews with artists, designers, and collectors, an ever-expanding online visual archive, and a growing database of texts that both enlarge upon and complicate the topic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			While much of this project inhabits the digital space, each interview also exists as a print publication that takes on a unique form that seeks to embody the key themes and ideas contained within it.
